# Mr or Ms?

One of the most difficult things to do in class, especially online classes (which of course have been held for years) is the correct use of the prefixes "Mr" and "Ms". 
For example, you see Parham Alvani's name in the list and you don't know whether you should say Mr. Alvani or Ms. Alvani. This website is designed to help teachers in this important matter! 
In this site, there are two general cases when the user knows the gender of the name and wants to save it on the site, and when the user does not know the gender and wants to find out through our site.
